This project sets up a systemd service that **randomizes your MAC address at system boot** for all type of network interfaces like (`enp7s0` and `wlp13s0`). It uses [`macchanger`](https://github.com/alobbs/macchanger) and works on **Arch Linux** or any `systemd` linux-based distro.

## üõ°Ô∏è Why Use It?

- Improve privacy by changing your MAC on every boot and with interval of every 5 minutes.
- Spoof MAC address to avoid tracking on public networks.
- Lightweight and portable on any linux based devices and runs automatically.

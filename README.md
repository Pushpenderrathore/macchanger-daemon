# MAC Address Randomizer Daemon for Arch Linux

This project sets up a systemd service that **randomizes your MAC address at system boot** for two network interfaces (`enp7s0` and `wlp13s0`). It uses [`macchanger`](https://github.com/alobbs/macchanger) and works on **Arch Linux** or any `systemd`-based distro.

## üõ°Ô∏è Why Use It?

- Improve privacy by changing your MAC on every boot.
- Spoof MAC address to avoid tracking on public networks.
- Lightweight and runs automatically.
